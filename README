The scripts directory contains the scripts (jupyter notebooks, python3 and shell script making use of cdo ) and data which were used to generate the figures and tables in the main manuscript Sijbrandij et al. (2023 submitted to GRL).
Script names indicate which Figures are produced. 
In these scripts we use the internal experiment names which differ from the manuscript: 
alakeGLAC refers to experiment REF13ka 
alake13ka refers to experiment PL13ka_{warm} 
plake     refers to experiment PL13ka 

For Fig1. Fig1_generate_significance_masks.py has analysed 100yr monthly mean atmosphere model output to generate the masks which were used in Fig1 to highlight significant anomalies. 
All necessary input data are stored in directory data

System requirements:
To use scripts/Tab1_extract_data.sh you will need cdo (Climate Data Operators version 1.9.3; http://mpimet.mpg.de/cdo)
For python and jupyter notebooks please provide the following libaries:
